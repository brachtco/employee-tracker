## Description

The Employee Tracker is command-line applicaton that is used to manage
a company's employee database. For this challenge, I have written most of
the code, but have encountered many bugs and am unable to get it to work.
Because of this, I don't have any functionality to present. This will have to 
be one of the challenges that I drop.


## Usage
